# React-Context-Lab-01  

## Description  
React-Context-Lab-01 is a testing lab built with **React**, **Context API**, and **Tailwind CSS**, designed to explore efficient state management and navigation patterns. This project allows hands-on experimentation with:

- Implementing global state management using **Context API**  
- Custom navigation system using **`NavigationContext`**  
- Dynamic routing and UI rendering based on context state  
- Styling components with **Tailwind CSS** for responsiveness  
- Creating modular UI elements with reusable hooks  

It serves as a structured sandbox for understanding **navigation and state persistence using Context API** in modern React applications.  

## Technologies Used  
- **React** – Component-based UI development  
- **Context API** – Global state management without Redux  
- **Tailwind CSS** – Utility-first CSS framework for styling  
- **PropTypes** – Runtime validation for React components  
- **Vite** – Fast build tool for modern development
